Algorithm in Java
==============================
  
**Introduction**: Algorithm implemented in Java.  
  ---------------------- 
  1. This repository was originally used to store code for algorithm analysis and design class, but now I am gradually adding code for other algorithms and data structures implemented by Java.  
  2. I believe this repo is helpful for beginners of the algorithm and students who are preparing for the **campus interview**. The comments are added in detail during my development process.  
  3. I will also commit some solutions about puzzles in **[LeetCode](https://leetcode-cn.com/)**.
  4. **Welcome everyone** to supplement this repo!

--------------------------------------------
There are statements about question in **every** java file so you don't need to get questions from website, but there is **no main function**. I added **enough comments** to the code so that you can easily understand.
